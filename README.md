# Economies-of-Scale-Polynomial-Regression
This repository provides scripts and notebooks that examine how production volume impacts cost per unit. By leveraging data visualization tools (Seaborn, Matplotlib) and polynomial regression, it demonstrates how increasing the number of units can influence manufacturing costs, offering insights into potential economies of scale and cost-efficiency strategies.

**Requirements:** Python 3.12

**Note:** This project was developed using Spyder(6.0.1) from the Anaconda Navigator, which comes with many of these libraries pre-installed. If you're also using Spyder within Anaconda, you may already have most of these packages.

**Important:** Place the CSV file (EconomiesOfScale.csv) in the same folder as the Python file (CostPerUnitPolynomialRegression.py) so the script can locate it without additional configuration.
